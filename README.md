# The Garnish

*A bar management system for artisans, not just accountants.*

---

## Manifesto

This is not just another piece of software. It's a statement.

We believe that the heart of a bar isn't in its spreadsheets, but in the craft, the atmosphere, and the stories shared over a well-made drink. "The Garnish" is designed to be the silent partner that handles the tedious, so you can focus on the magic. It‚Äôs the final, perfect touch‚Äîthe garnish‚Äîthat complements your artistry without ever getting in the way.

We're building this for the artist, the host, the creator. If you believe in the soul of your establishment, you're in the right place. This is for those who pour their passion into every glass.

This is for artisans, not just accountants.
